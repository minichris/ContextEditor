Global File Context Menu Editor

GFCME is a little program I wrote as a first year when we were first told we needed to write something with Windows forms and I wanted to learn a little before we got stuck in on the main project. It allows the user to edit the Windows global file context menu (aka the right click menu for all files). This can allow you to combine it with command line programs such as [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) to add useful options to your right click menu, such as one-click converting to a .mp4, also itâ€™s written in C#.
